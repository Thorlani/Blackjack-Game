        1. The game of Blackjack is a game of luck in which to win you have to pick a card that amounts to the sum of 21. <br>
        2. However, if you pick a card whose sum is less than 21 you will not win but you will be given the opportunity to pick another card. <br>
        3. Nevertheless, if the sum of your card is more than 21, you have lost the game. <br>
        4. Make sure to click the RESTART BUTTON after each card pick.
